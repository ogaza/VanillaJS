      This is just a regular paragraph, which styling is not affected by the
      styling from the template as the template is attached to the shadow DOM

      for example, but is ignored by the browser while rendering the page

        we will use this template as a markup for the 
        custom component. this will also be used within 
        the shadow DOM, so the styling here does not affect
        the main page's styling

        the same is in the opposite direction - styling
        from the main page does not affect styling in the shadow DOM
