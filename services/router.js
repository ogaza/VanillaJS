// there are two ways of changing the page's content
// one is to remove one content and put a new content
// to the DOM based on user's actions
// the other way is to show one part and hide the other parts
// using the hidden attribute like
// <section id="sectionOne"> ...
// <section id="sectionTwo" hidden> ...
// which is better?
// it depends for example on the size of the application
// its better to show/hide only in small ones
// but do we always write big applications?
